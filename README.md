### Marketplace for USC students.

**Contributors:** Scott Ng, Ambrish Parekh, William Masdon, Addison Allred, Andrew Garcia

**Improvements since Project 2.4:**
* Added additional information to the info windows on the map activity. Also linked map info windows to their respective item pages.
* Added an option to filter the market page by items being sold by friends. 
* Created badges that users would earn when completing certain tasks such as a number of items sold, or 
selling frequently in a certain category. 
* Made the filter page and the profile page scrollable to accomodate potential extra information. 
* Buttons provide visual feedback when clicked.
* Expanded the UI to be more compatible with other devices.
* Prohibited users from going back to a page that should not be accessible (i.e. sign up or login).
