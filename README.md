Marketplace for USC students.

Improvements since Project 2.4:

We added additional information to the info windows on the map page. We also linked the info windows to the 
view item page for each item on the map.
We added an option to filter the market page by items being sold by friends. 
We created badges that users would earn when completing certain tasks such as a number of items sold, or 
selling frequently in a certain category. 
We made the filter page and the profile page scrollable in order to accomodate the potential extra information. 
We tweaked the buttons to provide visual feedback when clicked. 
We expanded the UI in order to be more compatible with other devices. We also made the UI look better. 
We prohibited users from going back to a page that should not be accessible (i.e. sign up or login).
